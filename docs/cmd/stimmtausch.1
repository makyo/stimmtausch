.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBstimmtausch [flags] [world\-or\-server...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Run Stimmtausch.

.PP
Stimmtausch is a client for connecting to MU* servers. You can specify these in
your config file, along with information used to log into them. You can run the
"init" sub\-command to generate a config file for you.

.PP
You may specify which worlds or servers you would like to connect to on the
command line separated by spaces. For each, Stimmtausch will first look for the
world named that in the config file, then the server named that in the config
file if no world is found. Finally, it will try to connect to that address
directly, if you specify it as ":".

.PP
For example, say you have a server named "furrymuck" and a world named "fm\_fox".
You could connect to the world (which would be, say, the character Foxface on
FurryMUCK) with:

.PP
.RS

.nf
stimmtausch fm\_fox

.fi
.RE

.PP
Or you could connect to FurryMUCK with:

.PP
.RS

.nf
stimmtausch furrymuck

.fi
.RE

.PP
Finally, if you want to connect to another server entirely, you can do so with:

.PP
.RS

.nf
stimmtausch mu.example.org:8889

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can combine these at will, of course. if you have the world "spr\_rudder",
you could connect to bot worlds, plus a new server, with:

.PP
.RS

.nf
stimmtausch fm\_fox spr\_rudder mu.example.org:8889

.fi
.RE
