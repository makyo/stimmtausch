Once I started working on this project, one of the things I never thought I'd miss is the way TinyFugue indents wrapped lines. It quickly became obvious how much that helps with the scanning of text as it scrolls by, though, even if it's a pain to strip them from logs. Too many long lines and it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends. Dang ol' buffer-busters...

Besides, With logging enabled by default, my complaint might be moot!

Either way, they're back in Stimmtausch, and this time, they're configurable! You can indent the first line, the subsequent lines, both, or neither! Woo!
