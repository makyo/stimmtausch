After some useless faffing about with packaging (snaps: probably not; debs: yes, but ugghhhghghgh), I dove back into what I was *originally* working on, which is triggers! I got hilites and gags working, and will tackle macros and scripts down the line. For now, though, I'm feeling good! After this, I probably will give packaging a serious poke and see if I can get an 0.0.1 out the door.
