Well well well. Maddy said she was gonna write. Like...maybe some flash fiction, or start another project or something! But here she is, pushing code to Stimmtausch instead.

Now you can remove a world with `/remove`. This is mostly for if you have a stale, disconnected world in your session that you don't want there anymore. You *can* remove worlds that are connected, but since there's no way to reattach them, the use-cases are minimal for now. That might change in the future.

Also, a bug was introduced in the work to let you add more than one line, wherein an extra space would be added to the buffer and you'd get an error from the MUCK for silly reasons. This is now prevented.

All this work is on edge in the Snap Store now!
