Woo! [The milestone](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/2) and [the project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/2) have both been cleared of tasks! And you know what that means...*release time!*

As before, you can install via the PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -u ppa:makyo/st
sudo apt install stimmtausch
```

Or, go [here](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/releases/tag/0.0.2) and follow the instructions for downloading a .deb and installing that.

Again, you'll need to set up worlds, as described in the [last post](/2019/02/12/stimmtausch-0.0.1).
