Woo! It's been a rush, getting this far with a project I started on Monday night! Starting with a few scattered shards of code, I've wound up in a place where I'm able to connect to a MUCK and display it in the UI \o/

All the logging works, too!

Still lots to do - I can connect and read data, but I can't send anything yet. This is tons of fun, though :D
