## About

### Reasoning

TinyFugue (`tf`) has been the gold-standard terminal MU\* client for decades. However, it has largely been abandoned (thankfully in a very stable state!). Rather than attempt to take over the project and restart it, it was decided that a new client would be the best path forward: a modern client using modern tooling and design.

### The name

*Stimmtausch* is a compositional technique that shows up in fugue. Often called "voice exchange", it refers to the changing of motifs between the voices in a fugue which often occurs before the recapitulation. The goal was to have a name that expressed something detailed and well-thought-out. "SmallSonata" was also considered, but discarded as too twee :)

### Inspiration

TinyFugue, of course, was a big inspiration for this project, but [`mm`](https://github.com/onlyhavecans/mm) played a role as well, as a MUCK client written in Go using some interesting ideas. Many portions of `mm` are found in Stimmtausch, though, rather than use it as a library, it was modified to fit the design goals of the project.

### Development

* Stimmtausch is written in Go, and you can [read the docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/makyo/stimmtausch)
* Development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch)
* The project is governed by a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct)
* Any dev help is welcome, as are issues!

### Direction

Issues are organized into milestones (each of which has a project to go with it):

1. [0.0.1](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/1) ([project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/1)) - First release and packaging
2. [0.0.2](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/2) ([project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/2)) - Connecting, disconnecting, and multiple worlds
3. [0.0.3](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/5) ([project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/4)) - Logging
4. [0.1.0](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/3) ([project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/5)) - Macros
5. [0.2.0](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/4) ([project](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/projects/6)) - Max post size handling

Everything else winds up in [FUTURE](https://github.com/makyo/stimmtausch/milestone/6)
